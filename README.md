# Measuring-the-Severity-of-the-Signs-of-Depression-from-Social-Media
This project explores the practicality of using an automated ML (Machine Learning) system to estimate the severity of someone’s depression, based on their social media history. This is in response to CLEF’s (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum) eRisk (Early Risk Prediction on the Internet) 2021 workshop.
